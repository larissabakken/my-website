            I am a skilled software engineer with over 4 years of experience
            working with diverse teams on various projects. My expertise
            includes server-side development, building RESTful APIs, and working
            with Node.js frameworks such as Express, Nestjs, and Fastify, as
            well as PHP frameworks like Laravel, Lumen, and Zend. I also possess
            strong frontend skills, including proficiency in Reactjs, Nextjs,
            tailwind, material ui, bootstrap, angularjs, html, css, and
            sass. Technology is my passion, and my ultimate goal is to become a
            software architect. <br/> Currently, I am learning GoLang to expand
            my knowledge and skillset. In addition to my technical abilities, I
            have a C1 level of English proficiency and I am currently studying
            Norwegian A1. <br/>I have excellent hard skills, including
            proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, HTML, CSS,
            SASS, SQL, NoSQL, and Git. I also have experience working with
            Shopify and Vtex. <br/>
            Moreover, I possess strong soft skills that allow me to excel in
            collaborative work environments. <br/>I am an effective
            communicator, proactive, able to work well in teams, and capable of
            managing my work independently. I am always eager to take on new
            challenges and continue to grow my skills as a software engineer.
